        <h1>Public food shelter</h1>
        <p>A public food shelter, also known as a food bank or pantry, is a non-profit organization that provides emergency food assistance to individuals and families experiencing food insecurity. They collect donated food and redistribute it, often through a distribution system that includes food pantries and soup kitchens, and sometimes offer additional services like nutrition education and financial aid information.</p>
